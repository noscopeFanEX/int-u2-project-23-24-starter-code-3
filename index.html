    <h1>Issue</h1>
    <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 1 below. -->
   <p>Instagram has issues with their AI moderation system. It is allowing videos of people getting hurt bad or passing away in crashes, explosions or other Graphic ways. The AI also removes videos that are just memes or people in comments saying how they liked the video and the comments that spread hate usally stay up. The Meta Ai has issues knowing what should be allowed and what shouldnt so there are times that it deletes posts that are fine and keeps the graphic ones.</p>

    <h1>What it causes</h1>
    <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
   <p>There are kids that use the app and if they see people getting in crashes or other things that could be graphic the child might get traumatized from seeing it. The AI also allows for bots to be able spam the videos out so then people will end up seeing graphic videos multiple times a day. It can also harm Instagrams users because numbers may go down with how much graphic content that goes up because people don't want to see it.</p>
